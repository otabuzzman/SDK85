**Privacy & Data Security Policy**
<br>Last updated: 1. October 2025

**Local Processing Only**
<br>All data is processed on the local device. SDK85 does not collect, upload, or share personal data with remote devices or third parties.
<br><br>**User Data**
<br>Data handled by SDK85 consists of
  - instructions entered directly by the user,
  - 8085 machine code and data (together referred to as a _program_),
  - and settings to control the behavior of SDK85 (via Settings app).

**No Personal Data**<br>SDK85 does not access contacts, photos, messages, device identifiers, or any other personal information stored on the local device.
<br><br>**Device Information**<br>SDK85 uses screen size and orientation information from the local device to adapt the interface.
<br><br>**Files Integration**<br>Users may import programs from the Files app into SDK85â€™s emulator, and may also export or save their own programs back to the Files app. SDK85 does not validate imported code, and execution of invalid code may result in unexpected behavior.
