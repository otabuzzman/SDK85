**Privacy & Data Security Policy**
<br>Last updated: 28. September 2025

SDK85 is designed with user privacy in mind.
- **Local Processing Only**: All data is processed on your device. SDK85 does not collect, upload, or share personal data with remote devices or third parties.
- **User Data**: The only data handled by SDK85 consists of:
  - Instructions entered directly by the user,
  - 8085 machine code and data (together referred to as a “program”),
  - App settings, which control the behavior of SDK85.
- **No Personal Data**: SDK85 does not access contacts, photos, messages, device identifiers, or any other personal information stored on your device.
- **Device Information**: SDK85 only uses screen size and orientation information to adapt the interface.
- **Files Integration**: Users may import programs from the Files app into SDK85’s emulator, and may also export or save their own programs back to the Files app. SDK85 does not validate imported code, and execution of invalid code may result in unexpected behavior.
